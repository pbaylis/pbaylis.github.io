List of (potentially) useful tools:

- Website generation
    - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com): Static site generator; what this site is built on
    - [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/): I might migrate to this (uses Hugo)
        - Blogdown uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a (much) faster static site generator
        - [Examples of blogdown sites](http://awesome-blogdown.com)
- Other resources
    - [Ed Rubin's homepage](http://edrub.in): Ed has a more extensive list of tools
