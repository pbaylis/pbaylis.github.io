Just like Hyde, `git` was destined to be with `jekyll`...

I want to move the jekyll site on my computer to github pages.  I have a few options:
- I can just upload the output created by jekyll itself, but then I'll have no way to edit the pages (unless I leave the source in Dropbox)
- I can just upload the source files and let the server-side jekyll take care of it. 

Fortunately, there is a [githubp] to help me out. Right now I'm going to try just uploading the whole thing. Unfortunately I am a github newbie, so I'm going to document the steps below.  

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/git/pbaylis.github/io
{% endhighlight %}
