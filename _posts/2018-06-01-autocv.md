Creating an academic CV process that I only have to update in one place.

### Requirements
- Separate content from styling
- Content
    - Publications (saved as a .bib file?)
    - Other stuff separate
- Output easily to Long CV, Short CV, and Web
- Probably not going to output easily to UBC CV

### Examples
- https://github.com/jkeirstead/jk-vita
    - Uses R as a scripting language
- https://github.com/bmschmidt/CV-pandoc-healy
    - Uses Pandoc and bash (builds from jk-vita?)
    - Seems most promising
