Correlation is not causation, but I have noticed significantly poorer battery life on my laptop when running Ubuntu.  I think power management may just not be there yet for the linux crowd, at least for certain applications.  I'm switching the laptop back to windows and shifting my at-home linux work to a yet-to-be-built desktop system. Setup as follows:

- Windows 7 Pro 64-bit  
- `emacs 24.3` with ESS and AucTeX
  - [goulet] saves us a nice spot of time here by putting these together
  - Need to run `M-X package-install ENTER org` to install the newer org-mode
- R
  - And RStudio
- Matlab
- Stata 12
- MS Office 2010
