Here be dragons. And my notes on my Lubuntu setup. Why Lubuntu and not Ubuntu?

1. It's a server - I don't need Unity.
   1. I don't even think I like Unity, anywho.
2. Older computer.
3. Next laptop will use Lubuntu for battery savings.

Overview:

- Lubuntu 14.04 LTS
- `git`
  - `sudo apt-get install git`
- `guake`
  - `sudo apt-get install guake`
- `emacs24`
  - `sudo apt-get install emacs24`
  - More later: AucTex, LaTeX, R, etc.
- Beautiful Soup
  - `sudo apt-get install python-bs4`
  - `sudo apt-get install python-lxml` (for better parsing)
- Google Chrome
  - 32-bit .deb from [Chrome site](https://www.google.com/intl/en_us/chrome/browser/)
