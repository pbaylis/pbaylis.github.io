Work rules:

- Beginning of arrival in new space: 30 minutes of uninterrupted work
- No e-mail, no paying CC bills, definitely no dicking around on the internet. Momentum is important!
- After the frenzy, 25min on, 5 min off (pomodoro)
- Long-term schedule sketches out broad goals. In general maybe for a semester or something, right now focus on JMP.
- Short-term schedule made at the beginning of every week. Sketch out morning and afternoon activities. 
- At end of workday, write down what I accomplished in a work journal. It'd be really nice to do this in the same place where the schedule is, somehow
