It's wild how many times I've had to look this up.

```r
my.summary = function(x) list(mean = mean(x), median = median(x))
DT[, as.list(unlist(lapply(.SD, my.summary))), .SDcols = c('a', 'b')]
```

N.B.: This can be slow for very large datasets -- the `as.list(unlist())` formulation is the culprit. Possible to remove that, set colnames manually, and melt for speed.
