I'm an environmental economist with a coding problem. I like to think about interesting problems that affect people and policy, and 

Currently, I'm a graduate student at UC-Berkeley in the [Agricultural and Resource Economics](http://areweb.berkeley.edu) program, and I work for a variety of all-star professors at the [Energy Institute at Haas](https://ei.haas.berkeley.edu).

Before I started graduate school, I did sustainability consulting for [Ackerstein Sustainability](http://www.ackersteinsustainability.com). 

I also play ultimate frisbee for [Revolver](http://www.revolverultimate.com), a San Francisco team. I'm a proud graduate of [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu), and a native of Madison, Wisconsin.
