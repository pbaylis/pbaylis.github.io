<!-- Using a geographically and temporally dense corpus of Twitter status updates with nearly half a billion observations, I measure the effect of temperature on human mood, with implications for climate change. -->

What is the welfare cost of environmental stress? The change in amenity values resulting from temperature increases may be a substantial unaccounted-for cost of climate change. Because there is no explicit market for climate, prior work has relied on cross-sectional variation or survey data to identify this cost. This paper presents an alternative method of estimating preferences over nonmarket goods which accounts for unobserved cross-sectional and temporal variation and allows for precise estimates of nonlinear effects. Specifically, I create a rich dataset on hedonic state: a geographically and temporally dense collection of updates from the social media platform Twitter, scored using a set of both human- and machine-trained sentiment analysis algorithms. Using this dataset, I find limited evidence of temperature effects on hedonic state in low temperatures and strong evidence of a sharp decline in hedonic state above 70 F. This finding is robust across all measures of hedonic state and to a variety of specifications.

<em>[Default Effects, Follow-on Behavior and Welfare in Residential Electricity Pricing Programs][defaultbias]</em> (with [Peter Cappers][cappers], [Meredith Fowlie][fowlie], [Anna Spurlock][spurlock], [Annika Todd][todd], and [Catherine Wolfram][wolfram])<br>
We study default effects in the context of a large randomized controlled trial of electricity pricing strategies. By comparing results from both opt-in and opt-out treatment groups, we are able to estimate the effect of the program on "complacent" customers, i.e. customers who only enroll in the program when placed in opt-out treatment group. We find that though complacent households save less energy per customer, in aggregate they have a greater effect than customers who opt-in due to dramatically higher enrollment rates in the opt-out group.

<!-- <span id="popup"><em>Critical gas: Measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices</em><img src="images/projects/bike.png" alt="Critical gas" height="360px"/></span><br>
An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.

Don't include the above unless I have a good, polished WP.

<em>Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on US Electricity Load</em> (with [Max Auffhammer][auffhammer] and [Catherine Hausman][hausman])<br>
Using a panel of disaggregated electricity demand consumption data that covers the entire United States, we link a statistically estimated relationship between temperature and load to a set of 20 climate models to simulate changes in future electricity demand.

<span><em>Wildfire, Climate Change, and Moral Hazard in Adaptation</em></span> (with [Judson Boomhower][boomhower])<br>
We use natural variation in wildfire occurance to identify the inefficiency created by imperfect pass-through of firefighting costs in the western United States. Along the way, we contribute to the literature by producing a more complete dataset of wildfire over the last three decades.

<em>Refinery pollution and respiratory health</em><br>
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.
