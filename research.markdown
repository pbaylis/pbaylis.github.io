##Working papers

<em>Temperature and Temperament</em><br>
<img src="images/projects/temptemp2.png"/><br>
Using a geographically and temporally dense corpus of Twitter status updates with nearly half a billion observations, I measure the effect of temperature on human mood, with implications for climate change.

<em>Critical gas: Measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices</em><br>
<img src="images/projects/bike.png" alt="Critical gas" height="360px" class="shadow" /><br>
An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.

## Works in progress

<em>Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on US Electricity Load</em> (with <a href="http://www.auffhammer.com/">Max Auffhammer</a>)<br>
<img src="images/projects/projectload.png" alt="Projecting load" height="420px" class="shadow" /> <br>
Using a panel of disaggregated electricity demand consumption data that covers the entire United States, we link a statistically estimated relationship between temperature and load to a set of 20 climate models to simulate changes in future electricity demand.

<em>Wildfire, Climate Change, and Moral Hazard in Adaptation</em> (with [Judson Boomhower](https://are.berkeley.edu/candidate/Judson-Boomhower))<br>
We use natural variation in wildfire occurance to identify the inefficiency created by imperfect pass-through of firefighting costs in the western United States. Along the way, we contribute to the literature by producing a more complete dataset of wildfire over the last three decades.

<em>Refinery pollution and respiratory health</em><br>
<img src="images/projects/respHealth.jpg" alt="Refinery pollution and respiratory health" height="360px" class="shadow" /><br>
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.
