<em>[Temperature and Temperament: Evidence from a Billion Tweets][JMP]</em> | [Appendix][JMP-appendix]
<!-- SHORT -->
<!-- Using a geographically and temporally dense corpus of Twitter status updates with nearly half a billion observations, I measure the effect of temperature on human mood, with implications for climate change. -->

What is the welfare cost of environmental stress? The change in amenity values resulting from temperature increases may be a substantial unaccounted-for cost of climate change. Because there is no explicit market for climate, prior work has relied on cross-sectional variation or survey data to identify this cost. This paper presents an alternative method of estimating preferences over nonmarket goods which accounts for unobserved cross-sectional and temporal variation and allows for precise estimates of nonlinear effects. Specifically, I create a rich dataset on hedonic state: a geographically and temporally dense collection of updates from the social media platform Twitter, scored using a set of both human- and machine-trained sentiment analysis algorithms. Using this dataset, I find limited evidence of temperature effects on hedonic state in low temperatures and strong evidence of a sharp decline in hedonic state above 70 F. This finding is robust across all measures of hedonic state and to a variety of specifications.

<em>[Default Effects, Follow-on Behavior and Welfare in Residential Electricity Pricing Programs][defaultbias]</em> (with [Peter Cappers][CAPPERS], [Meredith Fowlie][FOWLIE], [Anna Spurlock][SPURLOCK], [Annika Todd][TODD], and [Catherine Wolfram][WOLFRAM])<br>
We study default effects in the context of a large randomized controlled trial of electricity pricing strategies. By comparing results from both opt-in and opt-out treatment groups, we are able to estimate the effect of the program on "complacent" customers, i.e. customers who only enroll in the program when placed in opt-out treatment group. We find that though complacent households save less energy per customer, in aggregate they have a greater effect than customers who opt-in due to dramatically higher enrollment rates in the opt-out group.

<em>Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on U.S. Electricity Load</em> (with [Max Auffhammer][AUFFHAMMER] and [Catherine Hausman][HAUSMAN])<br>
Using a panel of disaggregated electricity demand consumption data that covers the entire United States, we link a statistically estimated relationship between temperature and load to a set of 20 climate models to predict changes in electricity demand.

<span><em>Wildfire and Insurance in a Changing Climate</em></span> (with [Judson Boomhower][BOOMHOWER])<br>
We model and empirically investigate the interaction between spatial spillovers of wildfire prevention and the competitive structure of the fire insurance industry.

<span><em>The Psychological Impacts of Climate Change</em></span> (with [Nick Obradovich][OBRADOVICH])<br>
Using large datasets on human expressions, we identify psychological channels through which climate change will impact economic outcomes.

<span><em>The Impact of Air Pollution on Cognitive Expression</em></span> (with [Nick Obradovich][OBRADOVICH], and [Josh Graff Zivin][GRAFFZIVIN])<br>
We investigate the effect of air pollution on cognitive impairment using multiple novel measures of cognitive capacity from the social media platform Twitter.

<em>Refinery pollution and respiratory health</em><br>
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.   -->

<em>Critical Gas: Measuring the Bicycle Usage Response to Gas Prices</em><br>
I construct estimates of the bike usage elasticity to changes in the price of gas, finding that increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase.
