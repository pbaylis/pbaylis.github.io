What is the amenity cost of climate change? A growing literature documents the economic effects of climate change, but most work focuses on estimating the costs of acute impacts like natural disasters and crop failures, rather than the broadly experienced change in amenity value of living in a warmer climate. The estimates that do exist suggest that accounting for the change in amenity values could substantially increase the projected costs of climate change. However, these estimates are obtained using locational choice methods that rely on cross-sectional variation or survey data, both of which may be biased by unobservable factors. This paper presents an alternative method of estimating preferences over temperature that allows me to account for unobserved cross-sectional and temporal variation. To do so, I construct a rich dataset on hedonic state: a geographically and temporally dense collection of Twitter updates with over one billion observations, scored using a set of both human- and machine-trained sentiment analysis algorithms. Using this dataset, I estimate a consistent, robust relationship across all measures: hedonic state is unaffected by average daily temperatures below 70 F, and slopes sharply downward above 70 F. I conclude with a series of extensions documenting temperature response heterogeneity, other temperature-induced psychological changes, and present a preliminary method to back out a monetary valuation of temperature.

<em>[Default Effects, Follow-on Behavior and Welfare in Residential Electricity Pricing Programs][defaultbias]</em> (with [Peter Cappers][cappers], [Meredith Fowlie][fowlie], [Anna Spurlock][spurlock], [Annika Todd][todd], and [Catherine Wolfram][wolfram])<br>
We study default effects in the context of a large randomized controlled trial of electricity pricing strategies. By comparing results from both opt-in and opt-out treatment groups, we are able to estimate the effect of the program on "complacent" customers, i.e. customers who only enroll in the program when placed in opt-out treatment group. We find that though complacent households save less energy per customer, in aggregate they have a greater effect than customers who opt-in due to dramatically higher enrollment rates in the opt-out group.

<!-- <span id="popup"><em>Critical gas: Measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices</em><img src="images/projects/bike.png" alt="Critical gas" height="360px"/></span><br>
An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.

Don't include the above unless I have a good, polished WP.

<em>Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on US Electricity Load</em> (with [Max Auffhammer][auffhammer] and [Catherine Hausman][hausman])<br>
Using a panel of disaggregated electricity demand consumption data that covers the entire United States, we link a statistically estimated relationship between temperature and load to a set of 20 climate models to simulate changes in future electricity demand.

<span><em>Wildfire, Climate Change, and Moral Hazard in Adaptation</em></span> (with [Judson Boomhower][boomhower])<br>
We use natural variation in wildfire occurance to identify the inefficiency created by imperfect pass-through of firefighting costs in the western United States. Along the way, we contribute to the literature by producing a more complete dataset of wildfire over the last three decades.

<em>Refinery pollution and respiratory health</em><br>
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.
