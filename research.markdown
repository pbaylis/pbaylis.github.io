**Working papers**<br>
<u>*Temperature and Temperament*</u><br>
Using a geographically and temporally dense corpus of Twitter status updates with nearly half a billion observations, I measure the effect of temperature on human mood, with implications for climate change.

<u>*Critical gas: measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices*</u><br>
An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.

**Work in progress**

<u>*Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on US Electricity Load*</u> (with [Max Auffhammer](http://www.auffhammer.com/))<br>
Using a panel of disaggregated electricity demand consumption data that covers the entire United States, we link a statistically estimated relationship between temperature and load to a set of 20 climate models to simulate changes in future electricity demand.

<u>*Wildfire, Climate Change, and Moral Hazard in Adaptation*</u> (with [Judson Boomhower](https://are.berkeley.edu/candidate/Judson-Boomhower))<br>
We use natural variation in wildfire occurance to identify the inefficiency created by imperfect pass-through of firefighting costs in the western United States. Along the way, we contribute to the literature by producing a more complete dataset of wildfire over the last three decades.

<u>*Refinery pollution and respiratory health*</u><br>
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.
