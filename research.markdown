My work is primarily recognizable as environmental economics with a focus on human outcomes. 

**Working Papers**

*Refinery pollution and respiratory health*

Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and fine particulates, among many others. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on recent refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.  

*The lightbulb revolution*

The lightbulb markets has experienced dramatic changes in the last ten years. Using a unique, store-level dataset I explore these trends and estimate the effect of state-level incentives on lightbulb purchasing.

*Critical gas: measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices*

An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets, one yearly and one weekly, to explore the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city. I find that a ten cent increase in the price of gasoline leads to an additional 500 bike commuters on average using a fixed effect specification. I further find that the same ten cent increase also increases the "search score" of bicycle-related searches by 2.8 points. A series of robustness checks confirms these results, although some shakiness in the point estimates is cause for mild concern. The findings suggest that transportation planners should include the rising price of gasoline as a factor when determining future expected bicycle use.
