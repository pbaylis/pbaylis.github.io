A growing literature in environmental economics documents the causal effects of climate on a range of economic outcomes. Since many of these outcomes are directly or indirectly dependent on human behavior, understanding the effects of temperature on affect, a critical element in decision-making, is essential for the design of appropriate policy responses to climate change. 

In service of that goal, this paper builds a rich, novel dataset on human emotion to document the causal effects of weather on affect. By using a geographically and temporally dense corpus of Twitter status updates with over 600 million observations and a set of both human- and machine-trained sentiment analysis algorithms, I estimate a consistent non-linear relationship: affect rises slightly in temperature from about 0 F to 20 F, is stable between 20 F and 60 F, and slopes downward above 60 F. These results are stylistically similar to findings on the effect of temperature on other outcomes, such as income and crime. Taken on their own, they have implications for both our understanding of the effect of environment on human behavior and suggest a channel for many of the documented effects of climate change. 

An extensive series of robustness checks enhances confidence in the results. Notably, I demonstrate consistent effects across multiple measures of human affect and confirm that the results are not driven by users with higher or lower native affect choosing to tweet at different temperatures.

<em>[Default Effects, Follow-on Behavior and Welfare in Residential Electricity Pricing Programs][defaultbias]</em> (with [Peter Cappers][cappers], [Meredith Fowlie][fowlie], [Anna Spurlock][spurlock], [Annika Todd][todd], and [Catherine Wolfram][wolfram])<br>
We study default effects in the context of a large randomized controlled trial of electricity pricing strategies. By comparing results from both opt-in and opt-out treatment groups, we are able to estimate the effect of the program on "complacent" customers, i.e. customers who only enroll in the program when placed in opt-out treatment group. We find that though complacent households save less energy per customer, in aggregate they have a greater effect than customers who opt-in due to dramatically higher enrollment rates in the opt-out group.

<!-- <span id="popup"><em>Critical gas: Measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices</em><img src="images/projects/bike.png" alt="Critical gas" height="360px"/></span><br>
An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.

Don't include the above unless I have a good, polished WP.

<em>Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on US Electricity Load</em> (with [Max Auffhammer][auffhammer])<br>
Using a panel of disaggregated electricity demand consumption data that covers the entire United States, we link a statistically estimated relationship between temperature and load to a set of 20 climate models to simulate changes in future electricity demand.

<span><em>Wildfire, Climate Change, and Moral Hazard in Adaptation</em></span> (with [Judson Boomhower][boomhower])<br>
We use natural variation in wildfire occurance to identify the inefficiency created by imperfect pass-through of firefighting costs in the western United States. Along the way, we contribute to the literature by producing a more complete dataset of wildfire over the last three decades.

<em>Refinery pollution and respiratory health</em><br>
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.
