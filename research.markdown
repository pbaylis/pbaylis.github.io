My work is primarily recognizable as environmental economics with a focus on human outcomes. 

**Working Papers**

*_Refinery pollution and respiratory health_*
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.  

***

*_Happiness and temperature_*
Using data from Twitter, Google Trends, and over a million archived blog posts, I nonparametrically estimate the happiness response function to temperature, with implications for climate change policy and the literature on temperature and conflict.

*_Wildfire, Climate Change, and Moral Hazard in Adaptation_*

*_Critical gas: measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices_*
An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.
