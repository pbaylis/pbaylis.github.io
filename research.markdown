My work is primarily recognizable as environmental economics with a focus on human outcomes. 

**Working Papers**

<u>Refinery pollution and respiratory health</u> <br>
Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on recent refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.  

<u>The lightbulb revolution</u> <br>
The lightbulb market has experienced dramatic changes in the last ten years. Using a unique, store-level dataset I explore these trends and estimate the effect of state-level incentives on lightbulb purchasing.

<u>Critical gas: measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices</u> <br>
An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.
