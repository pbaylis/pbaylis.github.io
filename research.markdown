My work is primarily recognizable as environmental economics with a focus on human outcomes. 

**Working Papers**

*Refinery pollution and respiratory health*

Petroleum refining is a significant source of air pollutants. Using confidential health data and an original dataset on refinery outages, I estimate the short-term effect of refinery emissions on hospital admissions for respiratory issues.

<u>Happiness and temperature</u>

Using data from Twitter, Google Trends, and over a million archived blog posts, I nonparametrically estimate the happiness response function to temperature, with implications for climate change policy and the literature on temperature and conflict.

<u>*Wildfire, Climate Change, and Moral Hazard in Adaptation*</u>

Judson Boomhower and I use natural variation in wildfire occurance to identify the inefficiency created by imperfect pass-through of firefighting costs in the western United States. Along the way, we contribute to the literature by producing a more complete dataset of wildfire over the last three decades.

<u>Critical gas: measuring the bicycle use response to gas prices</u>

An increase in the price of gasoline causes both the number of bicycle riders and the interest in bicycling to increase. I use two datasets to identify the causal effect of changes in the price of gasoline on the level of bicycling in a city.
