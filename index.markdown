*Short bio*

I'm an environmental economist with a coding problem. I use the tools of computer science to map out our relationship with the natural world. Currently, I'm a graduate student at UC-Berkeley in the [Agricultural and Resource Economics](http://areweb.berkeley.edu) program. I am lucky to be affiliated with the [Energy Institute at Haas](https://ei.haas.berkeley.edu), Dr. Solomon Hsiang's [Global Policy Lab](http://www.solomonhsiang.com/lab), and the [Electricity Markets and Policy Group](http://emp.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My academic advisor is the incomparable [Dr. Maximilian Auffhammer](http://www.auffhammer.com/).
