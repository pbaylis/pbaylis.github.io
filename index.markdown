**Short bio** <br>
I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in [Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC-Berkeley](http://areweb.berkeley.edu), specializing in environmental and climate change economics. I specialize in developing new datasets to answer questions of foundational importance to environmental economics. My research supplements more traditional techniques in applied econometrics with modern approaches from computer science, psychology, and computational linguistics.

I am fortunate to be affiliated with the [Energy Institute at Haas](https://ei.haas.berkeley.edu), Dr. Solomon Hsiang's [Global Policy Lab](http://www.solomonhsiang.com/lab), and the [Electricity Markets and Policy Group](http://emp.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The incomparable [Dr. Maximilian Auffhammer](http://www.auffhammer.com/) is my academic advisor.
