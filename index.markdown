**Short bio** <br>
I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in [Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC-Berkeley](http://areweb.berkeley.edu), focusing on environmental economics and applied econometrics. I specialize in developing new datasets to answer questions about the impacts of climate change and how we might adapt to them, and how we consume energy services. My research supplements traditional techniques in applied econometrics with modern approaches from computer science, psychology, and computational linguistics. 

**Research interests** <br>
Applied microeconomics, applied econometrics, environmental economics, climate change economics, energy economics

**Job market**<br>
I am delighted to have accepted a one year post-doctoral fellowship starting in 2016 with the [Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment](http://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/) and an Assistant Professor position at the [Vancouver School of Economics](http://economics.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia starting in 2017.
<!-- I am on the economics job market this year. My job market paper seeks to understand the hedonic cost of climate change using data from Twitter. For more detail and my other work, please see my [research](research.html) page. I will be at the AEA meetings in San Francisco January 3-5, 2016.  -->
