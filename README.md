=================
- Full jekyll backend & frontend for personal website
- Note that I don't need to recompile through jekyll every time, github does that automatically.  Pretty cool.  
- I guess it also knows to redirect people to the index.html in the _site folder?  Or maybe that's from the older stuff?
