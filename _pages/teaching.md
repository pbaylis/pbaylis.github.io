## Prior

In Spring 2014, I was the Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for ARE212: Multiple Equation Estimation, taught by the inestimable [Max Auffhammer](http://are.berkeley.edu/~auffhammer/Maximilian_Auffhammer/Welcome.html).

[Dan Hammer](http://www.danham.me/r/) and I collaborated to produce a new set of section notes for this course. We think they're useful, attractive, and sometimes even kind of fun. Drafts of these notes are available on my [github repository](http://www.github.com/pbaylis/ARE212). Eventually, we plan to add to these to create a mini-course: a gentle introduction to graduate econometrics and programming within the statistical programming environment [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
