In Spring 2014, I was the Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for ARE212: Multiple Equation Estimation, taught by the inestimable [Max Auffhammer](http://are.berkeley.edu/~auffhammer/Maximilian_Auffhammer/Welcome.html). 

Additionally, [Dan Hammer](http://www.danham.me/r/) - from whom I steal website ideas on the regular - and I are collaborating to produce a gentle introduction to applied econometrics within the statistical programming environment [`R`](http://www.r-project.org/). Drafts of these notes are available at my [github repo](http://www.github.com/pbaylis/ARE212).
