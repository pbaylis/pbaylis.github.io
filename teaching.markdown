I am the Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) ARE212: Multiple Equation Estimation, taught by the inestimable [Max Auffhammer](http://are.berkeley.edu/~auffhammer/Maximilian_Auffhammer/Welcome.html). I am collaborating with [Dan Hammer](http://www.danham.me/r/) to produce a comprehensive set of notes that teach econometrics and `R`. The drafts of these notes are available at my [github repo](http://www.github.com/pbaylis/ARE212).
